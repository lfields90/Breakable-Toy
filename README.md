# StudyBuddy
## General Information

GreaterBoston (http://greaterboston.herokuapp.com) is a Rails app created by me
for my final project of Launch Academy's 2015 Summer Cohort. It is a site used
to give a more specific information about the neighborhoods of Boston told by the residents of those neighborhoods. It utilizes Ruby (2.0.0), ActiveRecord, CSS, HTML and Javascript.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, run:
<pre><code>rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed</code></pre>

To start a server, run:
<pre><code>rails s</code></pre>

## Testing

To run the test suite, run:
<pre><code>rake spec</code></pre>
